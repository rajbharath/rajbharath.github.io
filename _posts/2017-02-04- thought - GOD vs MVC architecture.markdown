I am just trying to realise the below statement.

  >  "Everything in this universe is related"

So I started to figure out the relations between the things/actions/concepts/processes etc though they are considered as unrelated normally. At the time of writing, I get one example that some of the properties of water and electrons are related.

Lets compare few properties of water & electricity

 - While water is running/flowing it has the kinectic energy. (current)
 - While water is stored somewhere it has the potential energy. (voltage)
 - Water flows from higher potential energy to lower potential energy (same happens in electronics world too)

Similarly my thought came across comparing between Software Space(MVC) vs Spritual Space(GOD).

`You may skip the below section if you already know MVC pattern`

###MVC Pattern Explained
I will try to explain MVC with MS Excel application.

MVC consists of 3 parts.

  > Model - The data/source of truth

  > View  - Different presentations of the same model/data

  > Controller - Logic to present the data as a view

&nbsp;

  - The data we enter in the excel is the model.

  - Graph, Bar chart, etc are made out of that data are the views.

  - The excel Application used for presenting the data to such different views (chart/graph) is the controller.

Below are few images to illlustrate that pie chart/bar chart derived from data. Also we can see the excel row/column representation itself as a view.

###Comparision between GOD & MVC:

`I have used those 3 religions just to explain my thought. My thought is not restricted only to these 3 religions. I see any religion/representation/god as I have explained. Also this is only my personal opinion not to disgrace others belief and I always respect others believes.`
