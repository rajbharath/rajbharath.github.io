Being a lovely dad of an year old child, I am exposed to all sorts of rhymes and cartoons. No surprise! I am addicted to that. One day my son and I were watching an episode of the 'Dora The Explorer'.

## The Favourite part
Usually at the end of every episode, Dora (main character in the series who explores the world with her friend Bujji) asks,

  > 'What was your favourite part of this episode?'

I have thought around this question for a while. Actually, this question is very important in all parts of our life. I am extending this question to a few of our real life scenarios:

  - What did you like in your *trip to somewhere*?
  - Which film or set of films did you enjoy a lot?
  - Which day do you still remember from your college/school life?

Usually, people don't find it difficult to figure out answers for these questions. Instead, they have bunch of answers and have trouble with which one to tell.

If we analyse the answers, these are really only the parts of their experience where they gave their full concentration. They must have lived each and every moment of it with little to no distraction, although the experiences themselves could either be joyful or sorrowful.

Coming back to the topic, to identify our own strength or weakness we should concentrate on what we do. Then, we easily notice when our energy level rises and falls, and what we are good at.
That way, we always have a check on our mood graph. One should live that moment so that we can do a self analysis later.

So,
live the moment,
and keep asking yourself,
