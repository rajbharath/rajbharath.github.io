By mistake a human,  by mother tongue a tamil, by nationality an indian, by graduation a software engineer, by profession a full stack software developer, by my interests a DIY guy, by poems and stories I have written perhaps a poet/writer, by doing mimicry/comedy may be an entertainer, by drawing an artist, by search for purpose of life may be a saint too, phew.... It goes on. I could not make myself out of any specialization with the actions I perform. With the bewildering definitions of each and everything surrounding me I could not derive myself what I am. Did you get that? Thanks for understanding.
